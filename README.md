# FruitsVegetables
Scrapes kalimati vegetable prices data, cleans it, and analyzes how prices of each fruit/vegetable changed on a daily basis. 

- How to use:
While scraping, cleaning and analyzing may be done separately, the easiest way is to run kalimati.py file.

- Keeping track of the processes in the logs: 
1) spider closes after scraping is executed
2) "Cleaning process executed" 
3) "Analyzing process executed"


- jupyter notebook file and code related to visualizations are incomplete and aren't part of the processes initiated when running kalimati.py
